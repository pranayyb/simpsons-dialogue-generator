# Simpsons Dialogue Generator

## Overview

The Simpsons Dialogue Generator is a character-based language model that generates text in the style of *The Simpsons*. Built using PyTorch, this model leverages the transformer architecture to create coherent and contextually relevant dialogue based on training data derived from the show. This implementation was developed from scratch, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the transformer architecture.

## Features

- **Character-Based Generation**: Generates text one character at a time for rich dialogue.
- **Transformer Architecture**: Utilizes multi-head self-attention to capture long-range dependencies.
- **Customizable Training**: Easily adjustable hyperparameters for tailored training.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
